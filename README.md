# Bragg-Scattering-Classification

This is an (as of yet) unpublished master student thesis project on Bragg scattering classification over water reservoirs in Ghana, written by Cato van Meurs from the department of Water Resource Mangement at the faculty of Civil Engineering at the TU Delft University. This project has been conducted under the supervision of Prof.dr.ir. N.C. van de Giesen. 

For questions regarding the scripts of reasoning behind them, please consult the master thesis pdf or contact Cato van Meurs at cvanmeurs.data@gmail.com

## Description

The program, written in Google Earth Engine, can be used to automatically detect the presence of Bragg scattering over water bodies in Ghana, using a Random Forest approach. Additionally, the training data created for the program is made available and the required functions for classification are provided. 

## Usage

1. [Sign up](https://code.earthengine.google.com/register) for [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/)

2. Git clone or download this [Repository](https://github.com/cvanmeurs-data/Bragg-Scattering-Classification)

3. Load the X.X.js file or find the published app

4. Click the _run script_ button to execute the script

5. Select location, date and year and execute the classification
